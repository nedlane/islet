# Creates the local code-signing certificate Islet builds against.
#
# Why this exists: TCC keys every permission grant on an app's *designated requirement*. An
# ad-hoc signature ("CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY = -") produces a requirement that is a bare cdhash, and
# the cdhash changes every time the binary is rebuilt — so macOS treats each build as a brand-new
# app and silently drops Accessibility, Calendar, Reminders and the rest. You re-grant forever.
#
# Signing with one certificate makes the requirement
#     identifier "dev.nedlane.Islet" and certificate root = H"<cert hash>"
# which is identical across rebuilds, so grants persist.
#
# Self-signed is enough — TCC only needs the requirement to be stable, not the certificate to be
# trusted by Apple. An Apple Developer ID works the same way and additionally allows notarisation.
#
# Run once per machine. Safe to re-run: it exits if the identity already exists.
#
# After switching from ad-hoc, the old grants must be cleared before re-granting. Every ad-hoc
# build that ever asked for a permission left its own orphaned TCC row behind, all named "Islet",
# all keyed to cdhashes that no longer exist — three of them on the machine this was developed on.
# Toggling one of those on grants the *old* requirement and the new build stays untrusted, which
# looks exactly like the fix not working. Clear them first:
#
#     tccutil reset Accessibility dev.nedlane.Islet
#
# then add /Applications/Islet.app in System Settings. Repeat per service as needed
# (Calendar, Reminders, Bluetooth, Location).
#
# To undo:  security delete-certificate -c "Islet Local Development"
